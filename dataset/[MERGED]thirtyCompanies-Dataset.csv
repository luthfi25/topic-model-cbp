3,"Lots of paperwork and emails. All sorts of information has been made personal. There are no design standards. There's a lot of paperwork involved. We're not sharing information. The design has not been standardized. There's a gap in the level of information with the manufacturing department. There's a lot of variability in training of subordinates. I don't have time to go to customers or partner companies. Improving the level of young engineers IT systems are not being used effectively Lots of meetings. Poor service to designers. Just carrying out development events and not much substance. Interdepartmental barriers Poor coordination with the factory. Development lead time is not improved. The costs are hard to see.

4,"Decline in business strategy Information management at each production site Product data is not shared between departments  Strengthen system integration and cooperation with each company Design data is not being used effectively throughout the entire manufacturing process. shortage of personnel Only a limited number of designers can be entrusted with important tasks. Insufficient efforts to develop human resources capable of leading the entire product development process The quality of in-process design data varies depending on the designer and design team assigned to the project. Design quality is dependent on the abilities and skills of some ace designers It takes time to train personnel (new and mid-career) Education in Design Skills You can't see the workload of various tasks and suddenly you discover that you can't meet the deadline one day. You're not managing resources across the design. As a result, the design man-hours are exceeded because of the large number of quality check items, which are called  product quality build-up . Design rework due to the manufacturing phase There is a lot of design-related rework at the production stage. Inconsistencies in the design work are not uncovered until later in the design process. Inability to incorporate data on manufacturing requirements at the design stage The exact performance of a product cannot be known until the actual product is built. Centralization of scattered documents Degradation of IT infrastructure System integration and linkage enhancement (including BCP) Response deterioration More data and worse system response. Development costs cannot be grasped in real time. Or, it takes a lot of man-hours to figure it out. There is no system to keep track of environmental regulatory data while designing products. Component information (discontinuation and regulatory compliance) is not shared among designers Design data is not being used effectively throughout the entire manufacturing process. Design data, documents and calculations are owned by individuals and not shared with stakeholders. Effective use of 3D CAD data Design products cannot be reused as they are owned by the individual Gathering, accumulating and passing on know-how Past complaints, defects and failures are not shared, so the same mistakes are repeated. Design know-how is owned by individuals and is not good at sharing it as departmental knowledge. Upgrading market trend research. System integration and cooperation with each company is necessary System Unification Integration of CAD systems and strengthening of linkages with mission-critical systems. And urgent BCP measures are needed. In particular, we need a system for collecting data. It is important to raise awareness that each person should accumulate know-how, not just a tool theory. Introduce examples of data use and develop new applications Centralized or virtualized database to clarify document storage rules We do not teach tools, but design and manufacturing skills necessary for manufacturing. A dedicated project manager's department and training environment is needed We need a dedicated resource management department. Analysis using a pre-validation tool is required. Manufacturing practice by the designer is required. Establishing a dedicated project manager's department for timely release to the market Update hardware (server and client), decentralize data, and make the system easy to use without stress A fundamental review of how design data is used is needed. Fundamentally reviewing the use of 3D CAD data and establishing how to utilize it.

That said, I'm having a pretty hard time with it. Early design - even details are hard to manage in the configuration. There are no rules for managing changes before the original drawing is registered (because of the importance of speed). Is it necessary to manage the deliverables of an outside manufacturer in the first place? And so on.　 Outsourcing Design Quality Improvement The business process at ODM is not clear. Groping Design Information Transfer"
6,"Weak marketing. Too many product lines. The products handled by the entire company have different characteristics, making it difficult to adopt a unified approach. We don't have the tools to collaborate. cost consciousness Know-how is focused on the individual. Insufficient information sharing Fewer derivative products, some of which seem to have popped up? Competitors get bigger through acquisitions, and the competitive edge makes the difference. Global Development Poor manufacturing and design infrastructure Control of overseas manufacturing sites (do you think they are not cost/quality conscious?) There's too much load on the technicians. Information is dispersed. New technology doesn't come out, and we become a normal company and go down. Other companies are launching new products that are vastly superior in performance. speed of development Training for managerial positions in the manufacturing sector Lack of technology We are so busy with day-to-day operations that we are not focused on improvement. Not enough software assets are being reused When there is a development problem, it is brought to light early Assign tasks to people of varying abilities without relying on intuition and experience. There is no shortage of development resources, even if it's an unexpected event such as a field claim or a special order response. Decide how far you want the quality to go and set quality goals. Why do we use these standards for quality, acceptance and inspection standards and for each component? It is clear why it was decided to do so. Why did the performance you thought you had established at the prototype evaluation stage not fail at the mass production stage? Consistent part accuracy between prototype and mass production Technicians are able to multitask and still manage New product launch schedules are taken into account in the frequency of drawing revisions. Sharing the image of quality and cost performance of design and procurement vendors Containment in the manufacturing process, not in the final inspection, can be specified by the start of mass production. There is design documentation to guarantee quality and is not dependent on the manufacturer's know-how Complaints, defects and failures are shared There is overall governance on common parts. Fewer modules with equivalent functionality Manufacturing of parts (discontinuation and regulatory compliance) is shared The parts we purchase are standardized. 3D models (before prototyping) are verified and there is no rework on the actual product. DR using 3D-CAD, etc., and all divisions are using the tools. If the specification or design is changed during product design and development, the change procedure is also fixed. No mismatch between the drawings and the 3D data when exchanging 3D data with the vendor during development. There's a tool to drop from E-BOM to M-BOM. It doesn't take a lot of time to investigate the problem because you can track down who changed it, for what, and when. No development delays because there are no omissions in pre-evaluation and verification and performance is produced."
7,"It's not development efficiency. Development schedule delayed. There's a lot of backtracking and delays in planning. Development resource management (with priorities) We don't have the ability to integrate with our global offices. Global, the organization is not making the most of it.

9,"There's no process available. No resource control. Not prioritizing issues and initiatives We can't always follow the rules. The development process milestones are not being followed. There's a lot of work to be done. We have not been able to train our people. Stock operations are not progressing. We're not using our knowledge effectively. Lack of resources due to rapid overseas expansion Different domestic/international capabilities. Ability to coordinate resources and schedules between projects at the program level We need a process organization to manage the entire project.

Quality problems in the marketplace won't go away. Cost increase due to rising material costs It's too costly to develop a control system. A long product development period and sluggish sales growth We're behind in our product development schedule. Delayed schedule due to delayed decisions Delayed schedule (development schedule delayed against schedule) Inadequate collaborative design There is a lot of design rework. Delivery time (schedule) Delayed decision-making stretches the plan. Design information is dispersed and not used efficiently. Investing in information technology is too expensive to start. Information is not being shared. Project management is standardized and there is no variation among model leaders. Ability to understand the amount of work involved in each project, and the appropriate number of man hours, members, and assignments. You can foresee the amount of time required to deal with problems and study issues (you can calculate the number of man-hours required) Adequate project management and no schedule delays Product development process is complex, but project management is good Additional work (man-hours) will be required for the management process, but it will also be understood by the field and maintain the man-hours in the field Development is taking place in other departments and we can see the issues and status of each department. Progress is not delayed even if the technology employed is difficult. Adequate analysis of capturing customer requirements and a product specification that is superior to the competition The way the product is used in the marketplace will be communicated to the developers. Customer requirements can be validated after market deployment Customer requirements (market requirements/issues) are also made known to the developers so that improvements can be made. It doesn't take a lot of time to select a system when information is scattered around. Technical documents are available to prevent past problems from recurring. The product development is standardized, which makes development more efficient. Flexibility in business operations, and easy to improve and innovate The information you want, such as cost and commonality rates, is readily available to advance your design. Standardized evaluation procedures are complete, with no omissions and no rework We are moving on to the next stage of the process, spending a sufficient number of man-hours (schedule) to make a thorough evaluation. The man-hours are sufficient, so we're moving on to the next step with enough evaluation and validation.

Legislation in various countries It's taking a long time to find the material. lack of resources Product sales (profit) version control Cost reduction, measures and lack of materialization Workload for designers Lack of time (man-hours) for activities The design data check takes too much time and does not allow for timely feedback. The design process is not automated and takes a lot of man-hours. Short development time Not following the design rules. Instructions are not being followed correctly. Lack of communication with the field communication Giving up because of poor 3D modeling How to make a 3D design model is disparate. The designer's ability to design depends on his or her skills. Insufficient IT skills in the company Broad knowledge required We are experiencing problems with database linkage with overseas offices. We don't know what IT information we have on our overseas offices, but we can't control them. The quality of design data varies from person to person. Many quality check items, time consuming. First the product sells and then the paycheck reflects it. Template design information and centralized BU The design rules are naturally followed. The tools and individuals in each process can be utilized without stress Visualization of the design result process of each project Process visualization and real time Fully automated design problem detection Validity can be verified.

12,"Differences in understanding the new product implementation process with the Region Business strategy is unclear. Not getting good marketing input (VOC) It's not designed to anticipate legal regulations. Design specifications change every time. We are not doing enough to respond to regulations. The criteria for determining change control are vague. Who will manage and maintain the drawings? The Go/NoGo of the project is not clearly shared (escalation path) Geneticization of processes (patchwork collection of processes) DesignControl is unclear Management like children's soccer. Gap between plan (budget) and reality organizational structure in progress Need to design with quality goals (of numbers) In uniters and assemblies, assembly drawings may or may not exist. I don't know the revisions to the product or components. Communication between Production and Design Lack of coordination between departments. Interdepartmental roles are unclear. The transfer of work between departments is not smooth. Design process without going back Since many of the treatment tools have the same contents on many sheets of paper, it is possible to make a single revision. Checking the drawings three times when revising them is a pain Aging workforce Inadequate global purchasing function Production and shipment disruptions due to procurement problems Unable to link target specifications to drawings and other deliverables Not registering sufficiently in line with the regulations There are no consistent rules for what to write on the drawing. I don't know (or can't remember) the numbering system, the rules for putting them on, or what the symbols mean. Failure to pass on skills and knowledge I wonder how much you think about after-service repairs. The design department is inconveniencing each department because of the schedule-first product development. There's a lot of work to be done backwards. Some of the design methods have not been established. I want the database of repair parts to be sucked out of production control (not shared). There are no guidelines/procedures on how to store 3D. The development documentation is not data-intensive There is no rational system of document control. Lack of information sharing between departments There are no rules on how to manage the original data of past review materials, handouts, and approval documents (rules on how to manage the server are not followed) There is no way to manage the 3D data. How to manage the old assets, the drawings to date Insufficient control of the raw data in the drawings There's a lot of accounting code, production code, project code (development code), etc. I can't track common parts or similar parts. An inquiry comes in because there is a part registered in the ledger with a number different from the part number. Searching for specifications is difficult because you have to check the number online and look at the original for content. I want to make a request for approval to the Quality Assurance Division and Production Engineering Group electronically. The concept of standard and common parts differs between design and production. Who maintains and manages the BOM and document management system? It's hard to rewrite old drawings. Weak management coordination (between upper and lower management) Global Operations The process for product recall is not in place. Lack of elemental development (technology) Administration's ideas are working negatively on development activities. The quality system does not fit the QSR Limitations on Funding There is a fundamental gap between top management and Japanese organizations There is no rational system of educational management. We don't have enough people. Lack of human resource development. Clarify product life spans and reduce the number of documents and records to be managed. To know that the requirements (VOC) match the product specifications. Set up a system that allows for clear requirements during development. Realize portfolio management in response to VOCs to develop and manufacture products that meet the needs of the market. Market needs are also in a state where regulatory requirements are consistently coming in as input and the design can start. visibility of the project, including in-process Alignment of design, product certification, technology and production awareness at the start of development Project and program management can be managed in a matrix way You'll be notified of what needs to be done and when to do it, by following a schedule and avoiding delays.

The presence or absence of substrate mold, shape and size are not controlled. Tool location data is not shared. To contact purchasing. It takes a lot of time and effort. You have to open the drawing to search for information. I can't confirm the specifics without opening the drawings one by one. Can't search for information by category (how many watts, airflow), it takes a long time. Information is not organized. I don't know if data is available or not, and whether it is mass produced or not. 2D and 3D are not linked to each other, so it is difficult to modify the data when the dimensions are changed. The conversion from a 3D model to a 2D drawing is time-consuming (automatic linkage is not possible, and there is waste from 3D to DXF to 2D). It takes time to check standards and environmental requirements. shortage of people Centralized management of design data in a database Manage various document data related to individually managed products by linking them to the product configuration.

Lack of skilled workers stalls field operations Work, documentation and product specifications are not standardized or rule-based Problems with deadlines and changes in delivery dates when making arrangements We are doing low-tech work, such as transcribing by hand from paper to data. We're short-handed and can't get the job. Not enough young people to sustain the organization. Can't keep up with customer demands (market changes) Progress in the field is controlled by daily reports and is not quantified. Not enough resources. can't see the cost. delivery time is tight We don't see any production progress. Production costs are hard to see. Unevenness in the content and information entered into the arrangement data.

Change the new business to another division that is more appropriate for the market."
29,"The lack of a marketing department has resulted in a poor product development strategy, with requests from specific customers being the main source of information. There is no place to do process design for the outside. There is no process drawings. This is an industry where capital investment is important, but because of the fast turnover, problems can come to light later. Prolonged problems with business partners. Staffing is not optimized, resulting in a concentration of people on the job. Medium- and long-term plans There are many parallel cases and no priorities, resulting in an overall delay. When we start a new development project, we estimate the schedule and development cost, but we don't have a culture of estimating man-hours, so we can't compare it with existing projects. We are not able to prioritize, select, and focus on projects. Because each person makes a convenient decision, things don't move in the direction of finding their downfall. As a result, it is not completed. As a company, our priorities for projects change from time to time, and each one is given top priority. The business is not progressing as it should be, and in the end the wrinkle comes. If the business process is carried out without us being able to see it, important parts are overlooked, and as a result, problems become apparent after publication. How to prioritize Speed of work Dealing with urgent business matters Everyone thinks of their own work first and foremost, so they don't think about the situation in other departments. There is poor coordination between departments. Because we are a vertically divided company, it takes a long time to develop information. Also, it filters. Our own departments are picking up what someone else has to do because there is a wall of work between departments There is no one to judge the overall optimum and they are thinking of individual optimum solutions. As a result, we will miss something. If I send progress via email, they won't recognize me unless I tell them in person. There are so many meetings that even if everyone got together, they do not try to solve the problem in the end. It just ends up raising the issue. If we're going to do something, we have to start by gathering people and gathering information. Process, documentation, and tooling are essential. It takes a lot of man-hours to copy and stamp the drawings and other documents to the destination when they are issued because they are mainly managed by paper. CAD system versions vary and multiple CAD data are incompatible. Information sharing among departments is not possible. I am asked the same questions over and over again. Learning and updating the latest technical information Since most of the designers have been with the company for about four years, they have no accumulated engineering knowledge. Lack of design capability for manufacturing facilities. There is a lack of standardization of operations and knowledge, leaving it up to the person in charge. Mistakes are made when making equipment because of the use of old drawings. Some products have not been sufficiently verified in the past, and if they are verified again, they may not meet the standards. It takes a long time for newcomers to be able to do their jobs because the operational procedures for quality control are vague and have not been established. quality control is not well established, and the same audit points are repeated. There is a lot of rework on quality issues, which is increasing costs. There is a lot of interruption work, so I don't have time to think about it. There is no time to look back on the past for issues. There are too many cases and not enough manpower. I don't have the time to think about developing my company. However, I'm in a state where I'm just doing my day-to-day work. There's not enough time for work. The capacity of the business is dependent on the individual, and the work is not averaged in any department, resulting in a large number of tasks being performed by a particular person. Many people leave the company, so skills are not accumulated. There is no generation in their late 30s and 40s, so there is a lack of manpower. I would like all employees to be motivated by the importance of delivering our products to our customers. The workload is high, but there are not enough resources to match it. The skills are mixed and the work is subordinate. The education system is not in place and there is a lack of skills as a business person. There are many people with a sense of indifference to the problem. Visualization of the entire project Need tools to enable management to make good decisions Change yourself before you look to others for change. Building a tool to automatically create a development schedule Clear priorities should be set by management so that they can be confirmed by everyone from time to time. Establishing a system for determining priorities A system that correctly checks each milestone. Make decisions based on data logic Build a tool to automatically create product costs based on parts costs and manufacturing man-hours Create an overall schedule across the organization and share it with everyone Process Standardization Fundamental reforms to realize visualization. In-house systems. Putting a key person in each department Construction of a database to compare and reference the cost and initial cost of similar parts Create a person who can lead operations across the organization Set up a standard quotation Tools for information integration Recruitment of medical device as key personnel in the manufacturing department Build a database that shows the yield rate of each product. Use the IT system to release a drawing. Interdepartmental collaboration and decentralization Monitoring system for manufacturing process and defect information Linking manpower estimates to actual results Build a tool that allows the planning department to make decisions based on overall profit and loss Clarifying the claim process. Introduction of experts, including medical device and regulatory engineers Nurturing young engineers Tools and authority decisions that can determine priorities Lightening of overall quality control, education Awareness-raising tool for each medical device and quality control Introduction of an executive retirement system Building a database of benchmark results of other companies' products Raising awareness of medical device laws and regulations Reforms in the proper way of doing business, not just speed. Motivation as a medical device manufacturer Definition of a technology roadmap by the planning department"
30,"The location of the necessary data for each department is unknown. The roles of each department are unclear. What was decided in the meeting was not decided. A lot of people don't come here to get much information. Data credibility (new product specifications) It doesn't know what the real market demands. Poor network environment. Where to share data The roles, duties and decision-making authority of each department are unclear and cheating. It's not clear what MUST and WANT: Everything is  as much as possible... It's not clear how the specifications are determined. It's impossible to make a decision without the actual object, numbers and comparison patterns. No FM on the input side and no checklist on the receiver side either: inconsistent and wasteful/often omitted. A lot of verbal and email-based communication, not form-based, so there's a lot of said and unsaid after the fact. There's an atmosphere where everything has to be on target to be evaluated and praised. it is not good at quantifying or writing down images and sensations, so it can't be recorded. The launch date is set, but it's delayed because the deadline for starting theme development has not been set. Stagnate when cost targets cannot be met because they are the same for different categories A failure to meet quality standards occurs just before mold manufacturing and there is a month or two delay in starting over. In some cases, new products are tested using old standards in quality verification tests, and there is no meaning to the original test. The timing of the development theme plan is delayed year by year, which delays the start of the project, but we don't want to have to wait until the timing of the launch is fixed. Sales methods have not been reformed due to sales proposals, and new sales methods are needed but cannot be improved. Training and other policies and plans are unclear and do not progress or grow because of the lack of clarity in the skills and techniques of development designers. Information required for the development theme (proposal, quality requirements, product assortment, design drawings, data...) and other necessary documents are not in place, the level of each is low, and it is necessary to redo the process again. There is no core technology to compare with other companies. There is no research department. The work is so subjective that you have to ask the person in charge at the time to find out. The task has not been passed on at that time and the same mistakes are made. While developing new products, we are crushing the bottleneck technology and are not able to develop advanced technology. Planning is not planned over a long period of time, so we cannot eliminate bottleneck technologies in advance. There are not enough people to handle the design. Time is running out in dealing with the most recent issue that's on fire, and you can't deal with it in a long span of time. Many of the necessary forms are not formatted within the company and are not standardized. The lack of a uniform format makes it difficult to process data in post-processing. New employees need to be trained, but training materials are not in place it doesn't go to get new information, including CAD, etc., and it exists in its old form. Projects are being released without marketing research, so no plans are being released that are ahead of the competition. Reworks due to poor product planning (lack of experience and time for planning staff) The target cost ratio is uniform and strict, regardless of the product. If it tries to force you to achieve it, it ends up being a cheap product. Since we have become a small quantity and variety producer, it is difficult to consolidate production numbers and lower unit prices (poor production planning efficiency). Direct communication between the factory and the planning side often fails to make sense, and meetings become a waste of time, which in turn makes design and development more time-consuming. Since the basis for the sales forecast of the plan is naive or is not practically held with the sales team, there is a possibility of over-investment even if the investment is calculated to be good in reality. What the person in charge of the project has been working on is quickly turned over to the  planning committee  (rework). There is an imbalance in the age of the design team members and not enough people in charge to turn it around by themselves (some leaders and many newcomers) The world doesn't need an office. There are no products that can really make the world more convenient and fundamentally solve the problem. There is no time or setting (place) for the new knowledge learned to be shared or made available. it doesn't have time to update (or learn) new knowledge. it's getting used to following. The scope of one person's work is too broad. Not being able to work with an awareness of importance. Not priority oriented. weakness for ICT-related issues has not been improving. A tool that provides an objective view of market value. Deployment combination arrangement simulation application (easy to sell, simple to design without worrying about procurement). Increase the number of satellites and feel for oneself first in the future of IT, mobile tools, communication tools and ways of working. The basis for sales forecasts and the basis for planning volumes, such as existing products that are affected, are tabulated and made visible (an accurate review) using a set rule. alignment between the inputter and receiver. The accuracy of the output is determined by the input. Progress management should be visible from everywhere, so that it can see how each department is working. Strengthen governance to clarify and ensure compliance with the rules for sharing information required for PLM. Focus cost reductions only on products that sell. Try to get it out first. Clearly set QCD targets for each development theme, and the committee will authorize them before starting development. After new product development, acknowledge and create technical reports as a job, and make time for them. Grouping of development products. Indicate which development patterns are present in the plan. A professional education organization. Make sure that steps are taken to share the status of the development design with top management. The system is 90% practical work and the remaining 10% goes to research. Separate the designers who design the immediate product from those who design the product in the next few years. The conference be able to say the truth. Launch = All QCDs accomplished ⇒ Launch is not the next theme, but rather a milestone in the process, and the initial flow and launch period are also considered as a period of development and brush-up. An organization that develops information systems and integrated development environments. Inventory holding simulator. An organization dedicated to these activities. No development practices are carried out. Skill Check System. Develop the ability to imagine things. We collect and analyze data from not only orders, but also quotations and inquiries (accuracy of the planning basis). An application that allows you to visually propose to your customers, like a car color and option simulation, and also shows customizable colors and size limits (sales promotion and inquiry efficiency). Gathering and analyzing what each salesperson is thinking in real time, just like Twitter. Resolution of only picking up the opinions of some of the most vocal salespeople (planning basis). A system that finds similar shapes, like an image search, to find parts that can be used in the same way to improve the efficiency of design and standardize parts (reducing development lead time and inventory). A system that finds similar shapes, like an image search, to find potential patent and design infringement quickly (development lead time). A system in which the discount rate is determined by the availability of inventory, like a system of price variation based on hotel availability (reducing inventory and increasing profits). As there are many similar excel sheets in the company, we are publishing a collection of internal templates as examples of improvements. The development environment, including ICT, will be raised to the same level as the world. Change the rules and attitudes so that product release dates are flexible, and that what's ready is listed in the catalog. Conducting online in-house study sessions. The rules include how to save the data and file names. Since product tests only leave results for passing or failing, the amount of data will be increased by attaching sensors and other means. To ensure that the rationale for promoting design based on product planning can be shared in a situation where it can be viewed at any time. Clarify the designer's role and which tasks need to be accomplished to be completed. Strengthening the training system for digital transformation, divided into new employees, mid-level employees, veterans and managers. In addition to the knowledge and advanced technology required for the future, research and major development on how to do the work. In order to make all the vast amounts of past design information available digitally, a separate task force will be organized to digitize all the information. Change the atmosphere from  it's natural to do it, if you can't do it, you're a failure  to  accomplishments are appreciated, if you don't do it, you've done well. Identify  themes to be developed through proper consultation  and  themes to be tried in the meantime. It's also necessary to back down in a friendly manner. Clarify  standards  and understand your competence. What is not set in stone is part of competence. It's not a matter of responsibility. Identify a concept that can be used as a guide and a voluntary priority. Add  if possible  to it. Stop and format the documents and forms for the moment only. Keep the information collected and picked up by the side that needs it. Design man-hours and idea maintenance should be the main task. The system is a one-size-fits-all system. It's not a complete system. Recognize that it's something we can brush up on ourselves with our running. Don't leave it to others and go catch it yourself. Determine the criteria for internal or external production. The quality assurance department will have one quality assurance department structure, rather than one supplier for inside production and one for outside production. Younger employees will be assigned to take charge of the development of diversion of existing products in the development pattern grouping. Make them aware of our products. Decide on a development concept at the beginning. Define what the new technology is, etc. Depending on the content of the project, a deadline for planning input will be set, after which it will not be accepted. We will use the communication tools of the future. As we proceed with development and design, the basis for sales and the quantity of the plan need to be understood and authorised. Quickly stabilize and improve the system (including the way the files are shared). The minimum data sharing location should be the same for all themes. Horizontal connections should be visible. Determine how the company decides on its direction and how decisions are made, so that they can be clearly defined and assigned to themes and responsibilities. A change in the way we work. New IT and places and all that. Feeling more efficient or a more rewarding way of working."
